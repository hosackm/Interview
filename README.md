# Interview
Solution for whiteboard problems during interview

# Dependencies
The app depends on [OpenFrameworks](www.openframeworks.cc) to work. Audio input is handled by RtAudio and the graphics are handled by OpenFrameworks.

# To Do
Delay Line has no way to combine dry signal with wet.  It currently supplies 50% of the wet signal running through the Delay Line.

Since one of the whiteboard problems was a Linked List, I'll create a linked list type and use it in either the DelayLine or PeakMeter.
